# Pong
The classic game of Ping-Pong using the Swing GUI from Java. This is my first project since learning the Java fundamentals. As of now it can only support a two-player game. Try to keep the ball in play as long as possible. If the ball passes your paddle, your opponent gets the point.

# To Play
Run executable JAR file: PongGame.jar
Player 1: Press 'a' and 'z' keys
Player 2: Press up and down keys

Game ends after first player gets 5 points (determined by 3rd parameter in PongGame method in Main class)
