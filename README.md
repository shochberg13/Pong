# Pong
The classic game of Ping-Pong using the Swing GUI from Java. This is my first project since learning the Java fundamentals. As of now it can only support two-player games. 

To play, run the applet from the Main class. 
Player 1: Press 'a' and 'z' keys
Player 2: Press up and down keys

Game ends after first player gets ___ points (determined by 3rd parameter in PongGame method in Main class)
